In my assignment, I created the code for a interactive art game, starting with a big black spider and ending with many changes to the orignal canvas. The code starts off showing a big black spider with eight legs and a face. Eight legs are created using the 'line' function, each with a different path. A face is represented by a ellipse at the center of the canvas. Two white ellipses showed as eyes, postioned on both sides of the face. The mouth is shows using an open arc. A 'mousePressed' function is applied to draw a circle on the canvas wherever the mouse is clicked. The 'keyPressed' function is added to detect when 'a' is pressed. Pressing 'a' the 'changeColor' function is called, changing the background color randomly to different eye catching colors. The 'changeColor' function generates random RGB values, resulting in a color change for the canvas background. This functioned is activated by pressing the 'a' key. Go ahead, enjoy making your own fun creative designs, and have a blast in this interactive art game.
